# 3D-AR-Capture-and-Display-System-project

* The Capture sub-system was constructed using wooden structure with green screen and cameras. Two cameras were used to capture the stereo front view.
* The table-top display sub-system was constructed using LCD displays and semi-transparent mirrors.
* The stereo glasses were prepared to observe the front stereo view.
